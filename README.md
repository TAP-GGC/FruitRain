# About Fruit Rain

Fruit Rain is an educational game designed to teach students of all ages the fundamentals of Java programming. Players answer questions by tapping the falling fruit matching the correct answer. The game utilizes a Makey-Makey controller with fruits and alligator connectors. This approach increases students' enthusiasm towards programming.

A short video demo of the project can be found [here]().

## Description
- **Difficult Level:** Hard
- **Target Audience:** 6th Grade to college.
- **Duration of workshop:** 45 to 60 minutes.
- **Needed Materials:** Makey-Makey controller, fruits (apple, orange, banana, lime), alligator connectors.
- **Learning Outcomes:** Fruit Rain aims to teach programming fundamentals in a fun and engaging way. Through interactive gameplay, participants learn about variables, strings, conditionals, and arithmetic operators. The project encourages students to explore programming concepts and consider careers in technology.
- **Workshop Description:** Participants will engage in hands-on activities using the Makey-Makey controller and fruits. They will learn about variables, strings, conditionals, and arithmetic operators through gameplay. The workshop includes a demonstration of the game's code and encourages participants to create their own quizzes. Fruit Rain is part of the Technology Ambassadors Program (TAP), which aims to promote technology education and empower students to pursue careers in IT.

### Similar Project: Slice It
Slice It is another educational game developed by the Technology Ambassadors Program. It aims to teach problem-solving skills and spatial awareness through slicing objects into smaller pieces. More information about Slice It can be found [here](#) (insert link).

## Project Setup/Installation
1. Download all files from GitHub as a zip file.
2. Open the FruitRain.pde file and update the file location of QuizQuestions.csv around line 447.
3. Download the Sound library and GifAnimation library in Processing.
4. Connect the Makey-Makey controller to your PC and wire fruits to the controller's directional inputs.
5. Connect the wrist-strap to the ground connectors on the controller.

## Usage
- Players tap the fruit corresponding to their guess for a given question.
- The game utilizes fruits connected to the Makey-Makey controller, with each fruit mapped to a directional input.

## Additional Notes
- The game was designed to teach programming fundamentals but can be repurposed for other subjects.
- Players can create their own quizzes by following the provided format in csv files.
- The game's code can be modified for further customization.
- The project aims to break down stigmas surrounding technology and make programming accessible to all.
