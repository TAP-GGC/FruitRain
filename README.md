# About Fruit Rain

Fruit Rain is an educational game designed to teach students of all ages the fundamentals of Java programming. Players answer questions by tapping the falling fruit matching the correct answer. The game utilizes a Makey-Makey controller with fruits and alligator connectors. This approach increases students' enthusiasm towards programming.

## Description
- **Difficult Level:** Hard
- **Target Audience:** 6th Grade to college.
- **Duration of workshop:** 45 to 60 minutes.
- **Needed Materials:** Makey-Makey controller, fruits (apple, orange, banana, lime), alligator connectors.
- **Learning Outcomes:** Fruit Rain aims to teach programming fundamentals in a fun and engaging way. Through interactive gameplay, participants learn about variables, strings, conditionals, and arithmetic operators. The project encourages students to explore programming concepts and consider careers in technology.
- **Workshop Description:** Participants will engage in hands-on activities using the Makey-Makey controller and fruits. They will learn about variables, strings, conditionals, and arithmetic operators through gameplay. The workshop includes a demonstration of the game's code and encourages participants to create their own quizzes. Fruit Rain is part of the Technology Ambassadors Program (TAP), which aims to promote technology education and empower students to pursue careers in IT.
